# Release & Versioning Process

- Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) is used for all packages.
- Releases are published via GitHub Actions (see .github/workflows/).
- Update the version in Directory.Build.props before a release.
- Tag releases in Git and publish NuGet packages.
- Document major changes in the root README.md and project-level README.md files.
