# Coding Standards & Naming Conventions

- Use C# 12 and .NET 8 features where appropriate.
- Follow Microsoft .NET naming conventions: PascalCase for types/methods, camelCase for local variables/parameters.
- Organize code into namespaces that reflect project structure.
- Avoid magic strings/numbers; use constants or enums.
- Write unit tests for all public logic.
